# la-stopwatch
Measure the amount of time that elapses between *lap times*.   

# install
`pip install la-stopwatch`  

# usage
There is two versions of stopwatch:  
  - `StopwatchNS`
  - `Stopwatch`

While both measure using nanoseconds, the second option convert nanoseconds to `timedelta` before returning any time measurement. All examples will be using `Stopwatch` because `timedelta` it's easy to read, but it doesn't matter each you use because both have the same methods.  

## basic
The first thing you should know is that time start when `Stopwatch` is created.  

```python
from time import sleep

from la_stopwatch import Stopwatch

stopwatch = Stopwatch()

time.sleep(1)
print(stopwatch.duration())  # 0:00:01.001374
```

Retrive the current time with `duration()`.  

## record
You can record each *lap time* for future analysis using `record()`.  

```python
stopwatch = Stopwatch()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record()

print(stopwatch.get_record(0))  # 0:00:01.001317
print(stopwatch.get_record(1))  # 0:00:02.002678
```
Use `get_record(n)` to get the nÂº record.   

## named record
Is possible to give a name for each record.  

```python
stopwatch = Stopwatch()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record("leo")

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record("thiago")

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record("matheus")

print(stopwatch.get_record("leo"))  # 0:00:01.001374
print(stopwatch.get_record("thiago"))  # 0:00:02.002231
print(stopwatch.get_record("matheus"))  # 0:00:03.003551
```

## all records
All records (nameless or not) are available with `get_records()`.  

```python
stopwatch = Stopwatch()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record("hello")

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record()

# {
#   0: datetime.timedelta(seconds=1, microseconds=392),
#   'hello': datetime.timedelta(seconds=2, microseconds=1447),
#   1: datetime.timedelta(seconds=3, microseconds=2614)
# }
print(stopwatch.get_records())
```

## chain calls
Some methods return the `Stopwatch` so you can chain method calls. For example, you can record how much time take to do each action if you reset every time after recording.  

```python
stopwatch = Stopwatch()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record().reset()

time.sleep(1)
stopwatch.record()

print(stopwatch.get_record(0))  # 0:00:01.001267
print(stopwatch.get_record(1))  # 0:00:01.000460
```

## context manager
`Stopwatch` accepts a callback as argument which will be called on exit of context managers receving the duration.  

```python
# 0:00:01.001578
with Stopwatch(print):
    time.sleep(1)
```

The advantage of context manager is that you can interact with `Stopwatch` during the scope.  

```python
# 0:00:00.000082
with Stopwatch(print) as stopwatch:
    time.sleep(1)
    stopwatch.reset()
```

The callback receive any extra arguments during initialization and the duration. In other words, callback receives:  
- Extra initialization arguments
- Extra initialization keyword arguments
- Duration
    - Inside `kwargs` with the name `duration`
    - Or as last argument in case `kwargs` is empty

```python
def on_finish(msg, duration):
    print(msg, duration)

# Success 0:00:01.001218
with Stopwatch(on_finish, "Success"):
    time.sleep(1)
```

This order helps maintain `self` keyword first in classes methods.  

```python
class Test():
    def on_finish(self, msg, grade, duration):
        print(msg, grade, duration)
    
    def start(self):
        with Stopwatch(self.on_finish, "Success", grade="A+"):
            time.sleep(1)

# Success A+ 0:00:01.001470
Test().start()
```

## decorator 
`Stopwatch` accepts a callback as argument which will be called on exiting decoratored functions.  

```python
@Stopwatch(print)
def main():
    time.sleep(1)


# 0:00:01.001281
main()
```

Under the hood decorators use context managers, so the basics about both are equal.  

```python
def on_finish(msg, duration, grade):
    print(msg, duration, grade)


@Stopwatch(on_finish, "Success", grade="A+")
def main():
    time.sleep(1)


# Success 0:00:01.001084 A+
main()
```

But yours functions and methods can receive arguments that you may find yourself wanting to use inside the callback. That's why the callback will include these arguments. Here is the order:  
- Function arguments
- Extra initialization arguments
- Function keyword arguments
- Extra initialization keyword arguments
- Duration
    - Inside `kwargs` with the name `duration`
    - Or as last argument in case `kwargs` is empty

```python
def on_finish(student, msg, duration, grade):
    print(student, msg, duration, grade)


@Stopwatch(on_finish, "Success", grade="A+")
def main(student):
    time.sleep(1)


# thiagola92 Success 0:00:01.000698 A+
main("thiagola92")
```

You can't use `self` when decoratoring a method, but it's not a problema because following the logic you will receive all arguments from your method.  

```python
class Test():
    def on_finish(self, student, msg, duration, grade):
        print(student, msg, duration, grade)
    
    @Stopwatch(on_finish, "Success", grade="A+")
    def start(self, student):
        time.sleep(1)

# thiagola92 Success 0:00:01.000500 A+
Test().start("thiagola92")
```

## async
While `Stopwatch` alone doesn't have reason to use asynchronous code, it can fit your asynchronous code easly. You may need this when:  
- Decorating an `async` function
- The Callback is an `async` function

## async - context manager
Whenever you are inside an asynchronous function use `async with`.

```python
import asyncio

from la_stopwatch import Stopwatch


async def on_finish_1(duration):
    print(duration)


def on_finish_2(duration):
    print(duration)


async def main():
    async with Stopwatch(on_finish_1):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
    
    async with Stopwatch(on_finish_2):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)


# 0:00:01.001196
# 0:00:01.001875
asyncio.run(main())
```

It will check whenever you callback is asynchronous or not before calling, so you can change the callback as you feel like without breaking your code.  

## async - decorator
Same as context managers, it will check whenever your callback is asynchronous or not before calling.  

```python
async def on_finish(duration):
    print(duration)


@Stopwatch(on_finish)
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)


# 0:00:01.002338
asyncio.run(main())
```

```python
import asyncio

from la_stopwatch import Stopwatch


def on_finish(duration):
    print(duration)


@Stopwatch(on_finish)
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)


# 0:00:01.002063
asyncio.run(main())
```
